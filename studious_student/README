This is my attempt at the Studious Student problem.

Study.rb is my initial attempt, but I'm still missing something in the comparison.

alternate_study.rb is a bruteforce solution where I create all of the permutations of the words, join the words within each permutation, and then sort the permutations lexicographically. From here I can easily pick off the proper result.

An example of where my initial implementation is having issues:

Input: ["ld", "r", "d", "lo", "rlo", "rlol", "l", "rd", "ix"]
Output: 
	Check: dixldllordrlolrlor
	Best:  dixldlolrdrlorlolr

Clearly Check comes out better.
